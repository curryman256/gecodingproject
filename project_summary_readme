in this project small dataset is used to deonstrate geocoding using open cage api as i dont have access to google api
this repository has main.py file and jupyter notebook(commented clearly to understand the processing of code.)



working of the code:(section1 and section2)
The code loads a CSV file containing addresses and their corresponding latitude/longitude (if available).
It checks each row to see if latitude or longitude is missing.
if  missing, it uses the OpenCage Geocoder to fetch the latitude and longitude for the address.
It updates the DataFrame with the new latitude and longitude values.
Finally, it saves the updated DataFrame to a new CSV file.


working of code:(section3)
This code generates an interactive map using the folium library in Python. 
It takes a dataset of geocoded addresses (with latitude and longitude) and plots them as markers on a map.
however few address were miscalulated so the wrong address were corrected in the following process


working of code: (section4 and section5)
Purpose: Corrects specific incorrect addresses in the dataset by updating their latitude and longitude.

addresses_to_fix: A dictionary where the keys are incorrect addresses and the values are their correct versions.

Loop Through Dictionary:
For each incorrect address (wrong_address), the script geocodes the correct address (correct_address) using the retry_geocode function.
If geocoding is successful, it updates the Latitude and Longitude columns in the DataFrame for the corresponding incorrect address.
Prints a success message for each corrected address.
